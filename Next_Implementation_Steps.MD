## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Component | Estimated Time |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | RAG Pipeline | 3-4 weeks |
| 2 | Chat Interface | 2-3 weeks |
| 3 | Document Ingestion | 2 weeks |
| 4 | Subscription Management | 2-3 weeks |
| 5 | Optimization & Testing | 2-3 weeks |

## Technical Considerations

### RAG Pipeline
- Ensure the hybrid retrieval approach provides accurate results for tax queries
- Implement proper prompt engineering for the LLM to generate helpful responses
- Add guardrails to prevent hallucinations on tax-related information

### User Experience
- Focus on simplicity and clarity in the chat interface
- Ensure citations are presented in a helpful, non-intrusive way
- Make the user aware of their token usage and limits

### Performance
- Monitor response times - aim for < 3 seconds for typical queries
- Implement proper error handling and retries for LLM API calls
- Consider adding client-side caching for frequent queries

### Security
- Ensure all API endpoints are properly protected
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Maintain strict separation between user data

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Complete the document chunking service
2. Implement embedding generation with Gemini API
3. Set up vector search with Pinecone
4. Create basic prompt templates for response generation
5. Test the RAG pipeline with sample queries
